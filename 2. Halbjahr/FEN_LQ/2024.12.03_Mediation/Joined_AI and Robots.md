### Joined Solution: What are AI-assisted robots
AI-supported robots contain a lot of sensors, which helps them to analyze 
their task and environment in realtime. The artificial intelligence part is to mimic the
humanoid abilities, and there are many ways how AI solves that. 

- **AI** is the term for machines capability of perception, logic and learning.
- **Machine learning** employs algorithms that learn form data to make predictions and decisions.
- **Deep learning** uses multiple neural-layers to build algorithms, which performs task in its own way, based of data sets.

#### Autonome mobile robots (AMR)
ARMs can move around their enviroment that happens via 3D-cameras and sensors. They can process their
 Information and can adapt to situations such as obstacles during their task. Depending on the branch 
their task varies. They do have the ability to ... (No Time) 

#### Articulated robots (robot arms)
Tasks can be executed quicker and mor precisely with artificial intelligence. To classify a scene
or objects the robots uses 2D/3D cameras.

#### Cobots
With AI Cobots can react to gestures and the human language. In addition, they can learn from it 
as well, without training.
