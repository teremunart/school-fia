### Understanding Key Concepts 

1. **What are algorithms, and how do they influence our daily lives according to the video?** <br> 
 Algorithms are sets of instructions used by machines to make decisions. 
 They influence our daily lives by determining what content we see, how prices are set, filtering media and managing stock market trades.
<br><br>
2. **Explain the difference between the “Ye Olden Days” approach to algorithms and modern methods described in the video.** <br> 
 In the past, humans programmed algorithms using logical rules (“if this, then that”). 
 Modern methods use AI and machine learning, where bots train themselves by testing and refining their decision-making based on large datasets.
<br><br>
3. **What is the purpose of the “builder bot” and the “teacher bot”? How do they interact in the creation of student bots?** <br> 
 The builder bot creates student bots with randomly structured brains.
 The teacher bot does not teach but tests the student bots against correct answers.
 Student bots that perform good are kept, while poorly performing ones are discarded. 
<br><br>

### Analyzing Specific Details 

1. **Why can’t humans fully understand how modern AI-based bots make decisions?** <br>
 Modern bots evolve through millions of iterations, keeping only what works and discarding the rest.
 The resulting structures are so complex that even their creators cannot fully explain how they work.
<br><br>
2. **The video describes a process involving “test, build, test.” Why is this iterative process effective in creating bots that perform well?** <br>
 It continuously refines bots by filtering out bad ones and keeping good ones. 
 This process ensures that only the most effective bots survive.
 <br><br>
3. **How does the collection of large amounts of data contribute to the effectiveness of bots?** <br>
 More data means longer and more detailed tests, which helps bots improving their decision-making. 
 This is why companies constantly gather user data, to train bots.
<br><br>
### Critical Thinking and Reflection 

1. **The video mentions ethical concerns about algorithms being used to monitor and manipulate users. What potential dangers does this pose?** <br>
 Loss of privacy due to monitoring. Manipulation of behavior. Lack of accountability when AI makes harmful or unfair decisions.
 <br><br>
2. **Do you think it is acceptable for companies to use algorithms to maximize user engagement, even if the process is not fully transparent? Why or why not?** <br>
 I think it is unethical if it exploits users or spreads misinformation without transparency.
 <br><br>
3. **Reflect on the idea that algorithms are tools that no one fully understands. How might this influence the way we interact with technology?** <br>
 It may make people more cautious about trusting AI-driven systems. 
 <br><br>
### Vocabulary in Context 

Using the video as a reference, explain the meaning of the following terms and phrases. Provide an example for each. 

- Algorithmic bots:
  - **Definition**: Automated decisions based on data and patterns.
  - **Example**: A YouTube recommendation bot suggesting videos based on algorithmic past viewing history.
- Linear algebra:
  - **Definition**: Mathematics used in AI to process and analyze data, especially in neural networks.
  - **Example**: AI training models use linear algebra to optimize how data points (like pixels in an image) are weighted.
- Builder bot:
  - **Definition**: An AI process that creates new student bots by randomly adjusting their internal structure.
  - **Example**: A builder bot generates new versions of a bot that tries to recognize cats in images.
- Teacher bot:
  - **Definition**: Testing student bots to see how well they perform a task.
  - **Example**: A teacher bot gives student bots thousands of images labeled as “cat” or “not cat” to test accuracy. 
- Infinite warehouse:
  - **Definition**: The number of student bots created and tested in AI training.
  - **Example**: A company running an infinite warehouse of AI models in parallel to find the best-performing one.
- Slaughterhouse:
  - **Definition**: The process of eliminating poorly performing bots in AI training.
  - **Example**: Inside the slaughterhouse, only the top 1% of models are kept while the rest are discarded.
