### Understanding Key Concepts 

What are algorithms, and how do they influence our daily lives according to the video? 

Explain the difference between the “Ye Olden Days” approach to algorithms and modern methods described in the video. 

What is the purpose of the “builder bot” and the “teacher bot”? How do they interact in the creation of student bots? 

### Analyzing Specific Details 

Why can’t humans fully understand how modern AI-based bots make decisions? 

The video describes a process involving “test, build, test.” Why is this iterative process effective in creating bots that perform well? 

How does the collection of large amounts of data contribute to the effectiveness of bots? 

### Critical Thinking and Reflection 

The video mentions ethical concerns about algorithms being used to monitor and manipulate users. What potential dangers does this pose? 

Do you think it is acceptable for companies to use algorithms to maximize user engagement, even if the process is not fully transparent? Why or why not? 

Reflect on the idea that algorithms are tools that no one fully understands. How might this influence the way we interact with technology? 

### Vocabulary in Context 

Using the video as a reference, explain the meaning of the following terms and phrases. Provide an example for each. 

- Algorithmic bots:
- Linear algebra:
- Builder bot: 
- Teacher bot: 
- Infinite warehouse: 
- Slaughterhouse:
