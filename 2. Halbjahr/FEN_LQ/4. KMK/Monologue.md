## Rollenkarte A

Ihr Name ist Carl/Caroline McLoud. Sie sind Marketingmanager der irischen GSO-Tunes ltd. und stehen dem Einsatz von KI basierten Systemen skeptisch gegenüber. Als ehemaliges Gewerkschaftsmitglied, haben Sie bei dem Einsatz von KI basierten Systemen ein ungutes Gefühl, da Sie Nachteile für Ihre Mitarbeiter befürchten. 

Bei einem Strategiemeeting mit der deutschen IT Services AG treffen Sie auf Herrn / Frau Müller, der/die von KI basierten Systemen absolut begeistert scheint. Sie diskutieren mit ihm/ihr folgende Punkte:  

- der Trainingsaufwand (machine learning) bis zur Marktreife
- wann ist der Zeitpunkt der Einsatzbereitschaft erreicht
- Entwicklungs- und Anpassungsaufwand zur Verbesserung der Systeme
- Kontrolle und Kompetenzen, welche man KI basierten Systemen einräumt
- Probleme der Steuerbarkeit
- Veränderung der sozialen Beziehungen am Arbeitsplatz
- Ersatz von Mitarbeitern durch KI
- Angemessene Förderung von Mitarbeitern, um mit der Technologie Schritt halten zu können 


Mr./Ms. Müller, I understand your enthusiasm for AI-based systems, but I remain skeptical. There are several concerns that need to be addressed before we fully embrace this technology.

| **Concern**                               | **Key Points**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Training Effort (Machine Learning)**    | - Requires vast amounts of data and continuous refinement.<br>- Training can take years with no guarantee of flawless performance.                                                             |
| **System Readiness for Deployment**       | - AI’s ‘readiness’ is an ongoing process, not a fixed state.<br>- Premature deployment leads to errors and inefficiencies.<br>- Quality control and real-world validation are crucial.         |
| **Development & Adaptation Effort**       | - AI needs continuous updates and long-term investments.<br>- Requires expert teams and significant technical infrastructure.                                                                  |
| **Control & Authority Given to AI**       | - How much decision-making power should AI have?<br>- Who takes responsibility when AI makes an error?                                                                                         |
| **Problems of Controllability**           | - AI can behave unpredictably and lacks full transparency.<br>- Difficult to control and regulate in business environments.                                                                    |
| **Workplace Social Relationship Changes** | - AI integration may create workplace tension and uncertainty.<br>- Employees may feel monitored or at risk of replacement.                                                                    |
| **Replacement of Employees by AI**        | - AI is already replacing jobs in many industries.<br>- Risk of losing skilled professionals with creativity and problem-solving abilities.<br>- Need safeguards to prevent mass layoffs.      |
| **Employee Development & AI Adaptation**  | - Companies must invest in training and upskilling.<br>- Employees should work alongside AI, not be replaced by it.<br>- AI must be implemented ethically to balance innovation with fairness. |

| **Müller's Argument (Pro-AI View)**                                                                     | **McLoud's Counterargument (Skeptical View)**                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI training will yield long-term efficiency gains, automating complex tasks and reducing human error.   | The initial training effort and resource investment for AI may not justify the long-term returns, especially when human oversight is still needed.                       |
| AI is already successfully deployed in many industries, and deployment timelines can be predictable.    | Not all industries are ready for AI. The transition to AI might cause operational disruptions, especially without clear guidelines or industry-specific customization.   |
| AI enhances human decision-making by processing vast amounts of data quickly and offering insights.     | AI might lack the nuanced understanding and creativity that human workers bring to problem-solving, leading to blind reliance on data-driven decisions.                  |
| The long-term benefits of AI outweigh the development and maintenance costs.                            | The financial burden of developing and adapting AI systems, including regular updates and expertise needed, could lead to unmanageable expenses for companies.           |
| With proper regulation, AI can be controlled and monitored effectively to ensure accountability.        | The problem lies in the black-box nature of AI; even with regulations, AI's decision-making processes are often opaque, making accountability difficult.                 |
| AI will take over repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more creative and strategic work.    | Automation of repetitive tasks could lead to job insecurity and feelings of disempowerment, especially if employees feel their roles are diminished.                     |
| AI is transforming industries and creating new job roles, not replacing workers entirely.               | AI is already replacing jobs, particularly those in entry-level or manual sectors. These new jobs may require specialized skills that current employees may not possess. |
| Early involvement of employees in AI integration helps them adapt and reduces resistance to change.     | Despite involvement, many employees will still feel overwhelmed by the rapid changes and may struggle to adapt, leading to frustration and disengagement.                |
| AI is a tool that empowers employees and does not replace them, as long as proper training is provided. | Employees may perceive AI as a threat to their job security, even with training, which can cause resistance, anxiety, and reduced morale.                                |



"Mr./Ms. Müller, I am not against AI itself, but I strongly believe that businesses must take responsibility for its ethical implementation. AI should empower employees, not replace them. How do you propose we balance innovation with fairness?"
