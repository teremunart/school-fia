> ### Comprehension questions:
>1.	**What are you supposed to do?**<br>
    I am supposed to create a wiki page about AI and robots in within the company I am working (TechSolutions GmbH).
> ---
> 2.	**What is the main reason TechSolutions GmbH management has asked the apprentices to create a WIKI on AI?**<br>
    I can assume since we are future IT specialists, management thinks we have a good knowledge about this topic.
> ---
> 3. **Why does the WIKI need to be written in English, and what resources will be provided to help with this task?**<br>
   The company is worldwide present, so having a global english wiki is better than supporting only one language. PBworks is the solution the company wants.

## Overview about robots and artificial intelligence
#### Robots and artificial intelligence: Revolutionary improvement in companies
The imagination of artificial robots, bamboozles us already for decades.
Ideas that were science-fiction in that branch are getting nowadays reality.

Companies do use ai-supported robots, to bring humans and machines together, to solve and adapt the
requirements of business models.

As a few examples, things they are being used for, are:
- harvesting vegetables
- serving in coffeeshops
- cutting, welding and inspect
- improving the safety of employees

#### What are AI-assisted robots
AI-supported robots do contain a lot of sensors, which helps them to analyze 
their task and environment in realtime. The artificial intelligence part is to mimic the
humanoid abilities, and there are many ways how AI solves that. 

- **AI** is the term for machines capability of perception, logic and learning.
- **Machine learning** employs algorithms that learn form data to make predictions and decisions.
- **Deep learning** uses multiple neural-layers to build algorithms, which performs task in its own way, based of data sets.

#### Autonome mobile robots (AMR)
ARMs can move around their enviroment that happens via 3D-cameras and sensors. They can process their
 Information and can adapt to situations such as obstacles during their task. Depending on the branch 
their task varies. They do have the ability to ... (No Time)
