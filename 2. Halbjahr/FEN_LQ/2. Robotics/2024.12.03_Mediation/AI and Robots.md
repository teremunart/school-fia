> ### Comprehension questions:
>1.	**What are you supposed to do?**<br>
    I am supposed to create a wiki page about AI and robots in within the company I am working (TechSolutions GmbH).
> ---
> 2.	**What is the main reason TechSolutions GmbH management has asked the apprentices to create a WIKI on AI?**<br>
    I can assume since we are future IT specialists, management thinks we have a good knowledge about this topic.
> ---
> 3. **Why does the WIKI need to be written in English, and what resources will be provided to help with this task?**<br>
   The company is worldwide present, so having a global english wiki is better than supporting only one language. PBworks is the solution the company wants.

## Overview about robots and artificial intelligence
#### Robots and artificial intelligence: Revolutionary improvement in companies
The imagination of artificial robots, bamboozles us already for decades.
Ideas that were science-fiction in that branch are getting nowadays reality.

Companies do use ai-supported robots, to bring humans and machines together, to solve and adapt the
requirements of business models.

As a few examples, things they are being used for, are:
- harvesting vegetables
- serving in coffeeshops
- cutting, welding and inspect
- improving the safety of employees

#### What are AI-assisted robots
AI-supported robots do contain a lot of sensors, which helps them to analyze 
their task and environment in realtime. The artificial intelligence part is to mimic the
humanoid abilities, and there are many ways how AI solves that. 

- **AI** is the term for machines capability of perception, logic and learning.
- **Machine learning** employs algorithms that learn form data to make predictions and decisions.
- **Deep learning** uses multiple neural-layers to build algorithms, which performs task in its own way, based of data sets.

#### Autonome mobile robots (AMR)
ARMs can move around their enviroment that happens via 3D-cameras and sensors. They can process their
 Information and can adapt to situations such as obstacles during their task. Depending on the branch 
their task varies. They do have the ability to ... (No Time) 

#### Articulated robots (robot arms)
Tasks can be executed quicker and mor precisely with artificial intelligence. To classify a scene
or objects the robots uses 2D/3D cameras.

#### Cobots
With AI Cobots can react to gestures and the human language. In addition, they can learn from it 
as well, without training.

## Advantages of an AI integration
#### Increased productivity and efficiency
Nowadays, businesses face more demands than ever before. 
Customers expect faster deliveries. Stakeholders desire higher productivity and efficiency. 
Employees want to contribute without becoming exhausted or injured. 
AI-powered robots help address all these needs. In retail environments, they handle repetitive 
or time-consuming tasks like checking inventory and alerting staff about out-of-stock or 
misplaced items. This speeds up product deliveries, enhances productivity, 
and enables human employees to focus on higher-value, less difficult tasks, such as finding 
opportunities to optimize processes, resolving AMR issues, or developing new ideas.

#### Higher quality and precision
Artificial Robotics can see and understand their environment and can perform complex Task like inspections
for quality controls.

#### Improved work safety
AI-supported robots do play a big role in the improvement of safety of the workplace. Companies in
the oil and gas industry use them regular to let them process data, to reduce in long term the risk
for humans.

## Functions of AI-assisted robots
To make a robot really intelligent, you need to give him many important functions.

#### Robotics and MLAs
Machine learning algorithms are mandatory

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
